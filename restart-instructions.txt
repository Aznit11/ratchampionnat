STEPS TO FIX THE ROUND OF 16 UI DISPLAY ISSUE:

1. COMPLETELY STOP YOUR SERVER
   - If running in a terminal window, press Ctrl+C
   - Make sure no Node.js processes are running using Task Manager
   - If needed, run: taskkill /F /IM node.exe

2. CLEAR YOUR BROWSER CACHE
   - Chrome: Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete, select "Cached images and files", then "Clear data"
   - Firefox: Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete, select "Cache", then "Clear Now"
   - Or open a new incognito/private browsing window

3. RESTART THE SERVER
   - Run: node server.js

4. ACCESS THE ROUND OF 16 PAGE IN A FRESH BROWSER WINDOW
   - Either use incognito mode or after clearing cache

This should now display exactly 2 days in the Round of 16 section.

If you still see 3 days, please take a screenshot of what you're seeing and share it.
